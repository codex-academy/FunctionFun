# Winter or what

Your friend sent you this message:

`Look at this tomorrow it will be really cold all over the country: in Cape Town 9, in George 7, in Port Elizabeth 5 and in Johannesburg -1`

Write some functions to find the hottest and coldest place tomorrow using the message above.

Remember to write some tests first.
