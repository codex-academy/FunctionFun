## Eating out.

Xola took the sports team he manages out for the evening. The next morning he got these WhatsApps from the restaurant owner.

message 1:

`Hi Xola thanks for joining us last night. Your team ate 8 burgers, drank 17 beers and 11 fanta's`

message 2

`Please send me the payment via EFT prices are as follows: burgers - 37 each, beers - 12, fanta's 9`

Write some functions to calculate how much money Xola should EFT.

Remember to write some tests first.
